first decompress other two zip files 
1)scream_detection_other_files.zip
2)scream_detection_other_files_part_2.zip


after decompressing them cut or copy their content along with content of this zip file 'scream_detection_main.zip'
now the the whole project data is in a single folder
what you have to do next is create a new pycham project for giving the name equivalent to the name of this project
and install these libraries in that new project

3)pandas
4)tqdm
5)numpy
6)librosa
7)sklearn
8)psutil
9)scipy
10)soundfile
11)openpyxl
12)sounddevice
13)kivy
14)kivymd

now
for running this project simply run main.py file

__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________-
if you want to train this model again (initially it is trained) you will need two extra folders 
1)positive
2)negative 

you have to put these folders in the same directory where you will find main.py
